# Agent lifecycle, attention, and recency

## Reader

Muxel maintainers implementing or reviewing agent-status detection and its sidebar UI.

## Problem

Muxel hosts long-lived agent terminals. A pane may remain open for days, work for
minutes while unattended, then sit idle overnight. The sidebar must answer three
different questions without moving rows or filling every row with noise:

1. What is working or blocked now?
2. Which agent finished work that has not been attended?
3. Which idle panes are recently active or old enough to clean up?

The detector combines terminal-screen markers, bell events, recent PTY output,
process exit, and provider-owned terminal titles. Transition timestamps and age
labels already exist. The remaining correctness requirements are to keep lifecycle
state independent from notification attendance, preserve durable state through
restart noise, and reject title updates that cannot be attributed structurally to
the pane's configured provider.

PTY means pseudoterminal: the OS interface through which Muxel runs an interactive
CLI and receives its screen-control byte stream. PTY output is useful evidence of
activity, but it does not by itself prove that an agent started or completed work.

## Product decisions

V1 uses provider terminal titles as the highest-fidelity signal available across
ordinary interactive TUIs, while retaining markers, bells, process exit, and a
weak PTY fallback. Hooks remain a future option for exact completion or failure
events, but are not part of the current product contract.

### Stable tree, informative labels

The project tree never reorders itself by activity. Stable placement is more
useful than automatic recency sorting in a busy workspace.

V1 changes only the existing row:

- `working`: live work.
- `blocked · 2h`: waiting for user input; age starts when Blocked begins.
- `done · 8h`: latest completed work, attended or unread; age starts at completion.
- `idle · 12m`: recently active; age follows the latest lifecycle transition.
- `idle`: ordinary middle age; no extra text.
- `stale · 4d`: an old Idle pane that may deserve cleanup.

Initial age buckets:

| State | Age | Label |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Idle | under 1 minute | `idle` |
| Idle | 1 minute through 59 minutes | `idle · Nm` |
| Idle | 1 hour through 5 hours | `idle · Nh` |
| Idle | 6 hours through 2 days | `idle` |
| Idle | 3 days and older | `stale · Nd` |
| Blocked | any known age | `blocked · Nm/Nh/Nd` |
| Done | any known age | `done · Nm/Nh/Nd` |

The exact timestamp remains available to later tooltips/history. V1 stores it even
if the current Tag component cannot expose a useful tooltip without more UI work.

`ancient` is intentionally deferred. A playful word repeated across an old project
quickly becomes wallpaper. The stored timestamps let us test alternate copy later.

### Done is lifecycle; attendance is notification state

Done and recency are different concepts.

- A semantic or reliable marker-based completion sets `completed_at` and latches
  Done until later Working or Blocked evidence. It survives focus and restarts and
  has no timeout.
- Attending the pane records `last_attended_at` and clears notification emphasis.
  It does not rewrite lifecycle state or age.
- Every deliberate terminal selection refreshes `last_attended_at`, even when no
  completion is pending. This keeps read/unread notification state independent
  from the last lifecycle observation.
- Merely having PTY output remains weak runtime evidence. It never creates a
  durable completion claim.
- Blocked remains Blocked until the detector reports another state. Its age is
  derived from the first transition into Blocked.

V1 attendance remains explicit pane selection/focus. It is an acknowledgement
action for notifications, not a lifecycle transition.

### Evidence must remain honest

Strong signals:

- a provider's semantic OSC terminal title;
- a configured on-screen working or blocked marker;
- terminal bell;
- child-process exit.

Weak signals:

- recent PTY output for a marker-less agent;
- screen redraws, resize output, and echoed user input.

Weak output may support temporary Working display for compatibility. It must not
set `completed_at` or create a Done latch. The UI must not say `finished` when the
only observation was `last output`.

## Provider title contracts

Terminal programs set their title with OSC escape sequences. Muxel already parses
and retains the latest title for pane naming and Codex session identity. Lifecycle
detection adds a separate parser so provider state decorations never leak into the
persisted display name. OSC events carry no sender process identity, so known agent
panes accept title-derived lifecycle observations only from their provider's
structural title contract. Automatic names also require provider ownership: Claude
and Grok expose it in their structural title, while Codex persists it against a
session UUID. A child command's foreign title updates neither the automatic name
nor title-derived lifecycle state; plain shell panes retain ordinary OSC-title
behavior.

### Codex

V1 uses the Codex semantic title contract verified with version 0.145.0. Muxel
does not version-gate the parser; it validates title values actually observed.
Muxel requests `thread`, `run-state`, and `activity` at launch. The
parser reads lifecycle only from the final state/activity segment and returns the
thread segment as a naming fallback, so words such as `working` or `ready` inside a
thread name cannot forge status. For a bound local Codex pane, Muxel reads the
latest nonblank `thread_name` for that exact session UUID from Codex's append-only
`session_index.jsonl`. That Codex-owned value takes precedence in persistence,
tabs, and the sidebar, so `/rename` updates the pane while an `npm` child cannot.
Remote Codex panes cannot read the remote host's index and retain the structural
OSC-title fallback. Manual Muxel names remain a separate override and still win at
render time. If the local index is briefly unavailable, a bound pane keeps its
last persisted automatic name, then its preset label; it never falls back to live
OSC naming.

Muxel adopts a Codex UUID only while the pane is unbound and only when the UUID is
the complete thread field of a valid semantic title. Later OSC titles cannot
replace the saved UUID because terminal-title events carry no sender process
identity. In-process conversation switches are therefore not persisted; creating
a new pane establishes a different durable resume binding.

Muxel does not install or upgrade Codex. Diagnostics may recommend upgrading when
the expected semantic title contract is absent.

### Claude

The captured Claude Code 2.1.220 trace publishes `✳ <session>` while idle,
alternates `⠂` and `⠐` roughly once a second for the full turn, then restores `✳`
on completion. Treat only those confirmed prefixes as semantic state. A parsed
title state does not expire on elapsed time alone; the next provider-owned frame
or process exit replaces it. Strip the prefix before accepting the remainder as
an automatic pane name. Keep the on-screen `esc to interrupt` marker as independent
Working evidence: Claude can leave its title in the Idle shape while review or
orchestration work is still active.

Claude also supports OSC 9;4 terminal progress, controlled by
`terminalProgressBarEnabled`, but emits it only for terminals it recognizes as
supporting the protocol. Muxel currently presents `TERM=xterm-256color`, and the
local trace contained no OSC 9;4 events. Do not lie about terminal identity merely
to enable a redundant signal.

### Grok

The captured Grok 0.2.112 trace uses its default title items: action-required,
spinner, activity, session-name, and `grok`. Its source holds each of eight braille
frames for about 264 ms. The trace observed:

```text
grok
⠦ - Waiting for response… - grok
⠹ - Responding - <generated session title> - grok
<generated session title> - grok
```

Treat a complete leading spinner/activity prefix as Working, a complete leading
`⚠ Action Required`/spinner/activity prefix as Blocked, and the stable title
without that prefix as Idle. Strip only those leading protocol fields and trailing
`grok` before pane naming; reserved words inside the generated session name are
still name text. The title config is user-editable, so an incomplete reserved
prefix makes no lifecycle claim; a title with the provider sentinel may still
update the session name. Muxel must not rewrite the global Grok config.

Grok intentionally blinks the action-required title item while unfocused. Muxel
holds the last positive Blocked edge for 750 ms through that off-frame. A stable
Idle title clears the hold immediately; resolving a prompt can therefore leave no
more than a short Blocked tail before Working resumes.

Grok supports OSC 9;4 too, but its own support matrix disables that channel for
Alacritty/xterm-style terminals. The local Muxel trace therefore correctly had no
progress events while its ordinary OSC title animated.

Provider parsing must be pure and table-tested. Provider-specific syntax belongs
in `muxel-terminal`; the app consumes a provider-neutral observation.

## Data model

Persist one backward-compatible struct on each terminal `Instance`:

```rust
pub struct AgentActivity {
    pub work_started_at: Option<i64>,
    pub completed_at: Option<i64>,
    pub blocked_at: Option<i64>,
    pub last_attended_at: Option<i64>,
    pub last_state: Option<AgentActivityState>,
}
```

Timestamps are Unix milliseconds in UTC. Millisecond ordering prevents a completion
in the same wall-clock second as attendance from disappearing. They are
timezone-independent and
compare directly. UI formatting uses local time only when an exact tooltip is
shown. Negative ages caused by clock adjustment clamp to zero.

Lifecycle and unread notification state are separate. `last_state` is the
authoritative lifecycle value; workspaces written before that field existed infer
it from their newest transition timestamp. An unread completion is derived:

```text
last_state == Done
  && completed_at exists
  && (last_attended_at is missing || completed_at > last_attended_at)
```

There is no persisted `unseen` boolean that can disagree with the timestamps.
Non-terminal panes leave the struct at its default.

Transition rules are pure and live in `muxel-core`:

- entering Working records `work_started_at` for the new run;
- entering Blocked records `blocked_at` once;
- entering Done records `completed_at` once for that completion;
- every transition records the latest lifecycle state;
- attending records `last_attended_at` without changing lifecycle state;
- leaving Blocked for Working, Idle, or Done clears the active `blocked_at` value;
- PTY-only activity remains a runtime fallback and never records completion.

V1 does not store an event log or run ring buffer. The fields leave room for a
capped history later without forcing replay machinery into ordinary rendering.

## Runtime flow

1. `MuxelListener` records each OSC title change with a monotonically increasing
   generation, rather than exposing only the latest string.
2. `TerminalView` parses unseen title changes into a provider-neutral lifecycle
   observation and combines it with existing marker, bell, output, and exit signals.
3. The existing background status refresh reads the local Codex session index
   once per refresh when any bound local Codex pane exists. It maps names by exact
   session UUID; later valid rows win and malformed or blank rows are ignored.
4. `MuxelApp::tick` compares the displayed status with its previous status and
   applies one pure transition to the instance's persisted `AgentActivity`.
5. Changed activity or automatic names are persisted. Repeated identical
   one-second samples do not write the workspace file.
6. Focusing a Done pane records attendance and clears notification emphasis; the
   runtime and persisted Done state remain unchanged.
7. Sidebar rendering derives a compact label from status, activity, and current
   time. It schedules no continuous animation; the existing tick is enough for
   minute/hour/day bucket changes.

## Sidebar layout

The status Tag owns its intrinsic width. The title owns only remaining width:

```text
[agent icon] [worktree dot] [title…                 ] [done · 8h]
```

The title container uses `flex_1`, `min_w_0`, hidden overflow, no wrapping, and an
ellipsis. The status Tag uses `flex_none`. A long title must never push the status
out of the sidebar.

Under narrow width the title truncates first. V1 keeps the full status label. If
future labels become materially longer, a later responsive rule may drop age text
while preserving the state word.

## Research probe

The probe is a developer binary in `muxel-terminal`, not product UI. It uses the
same `portable-pty` and Alacritty parser as Muxel so observations match production.

Goals:

- launch Claude, Codex, or Grok in an isolated PTY;
- record timestamped OSC title changes, OSC 9;4 progress state, bell events,
  output-idle boundaries, process exit, and scripted input boundaries;
- avoid recording conversation contents;
- write newline-delimited JSON suitable for replay and comparison;
- support an explicit command/argument list rather than shell interpolation;
- terminate only the child it launched;
- make no global CLI configuration changes.

The probe inherits its process cwd. Leaving `CommandSpec.cwd` unset starts ConPTY
in the user profile on Windows, which can open a provider project-picker instead
of exercising a turn. Initial-prompt scenarios should pass the prompt as one argv
token; scripted typing remains useful for the separate type-without-submit case.

### Evidence captured 2026-07-28

- Claude Code 2.1.220: idle star → alternating two-frame title spinner → idle star.
- Grok 0.2.112: eight-frame title spinner plus activity → stable generated title.
- Codex 0.145.0 with Muxel's invocation-local title config: Ready → Starting/
  Working spinner → Ready.
- None emitted OSC 9;4 under Muxel's current terminal identity. This is expected
  from the Claude and Grok support documentation, not evidence that the protocol
  does not exist.

By default title records contain only their leading Unicode code point and character
count. Exact title text is emitted only with `--include-title-text`, for an isolated
harmless test session; provider titles can contain project or task names.

Build and run it as:

```powershell
cargo build -p muxel-terminal --bin agent-title-probe
target/debug/agent-title-probe.exe --log "$env:TEMP/muxel-codex-title.jsonl" `
  --include-title-text -- codex --config "tui.terminal_title=['thread','run-state','activity']"
```

Add `--script "$env:TEMP/muxel-probe-actions.json"` before `--` for unattended
runs. The JSON is an array of relative-delay actions, for example
`[{"after_ms":5000,"input":"Reply OK.\r"},{"after_ms":15000,"kill":true}]`.
Input text is sent to the provider but only its byte count enters the trace. Keep
scripts in the OS temporary directory; never commit prompts or captured titles.

Probe scenarios per provider:

1. cold launch to ready;
2. type without submitting;
3. submit a short answer;
4. submit a tool-using task;
5. reach a permission/action-required prompt;
6. finish normally;
7. interrupt during work;
8. resume an existing session;
9. resize while idle and while working;
10. exit.
11. finish an agent turn while a spawned server or other background command keeps
    running and repainting the TUI.

For each scenario, compare title observations with visible provider state. Hooks or
structured provider output may be used as laboratory ground truth, but product
status must not depend on global hooks. Captured fixtures are scrubbed before they
enter the repository.

The probe is complete when it can produce a compact trace showing whether each
provider distinguishes Ready, Working, Blocked, Done, and Exit without inspecting
conversation text. In the background-command scenario, a semantic Ready/Idle title
must outrank continuing PTY output: status describes the agent's attention state,
not whether any descendant process is alive. A future `background · N` state needs
structured job-count evidence; provider prose such as `1 command still running`
is not a durable product contract.

## Automated coverage

### `muxel-core`

- old workspaces deserialize with default activity data;
- Working, Blocked, Done, and attendance transitions stamp only intended fields;
- repeated samples do not reset transition timestamps;
- Done survives serialization whether its notification is read or unread;
- old activity records infer lifecycle from their transition timestamps;
- attendance clears unseen notification state without changing lifecycle or age;
- future timestamps clamp to a zero-age display;
- label boundaries cover 59m/60m, 5h/6h, and 2d/3d;
- Done and Blocked never lose their state word at old ages.

### `muxel-terminal`

- each confirmed provider title fixture maps to the expected neutral observation;
- lifecycle decorations strip cleanly from display titles;
- known agent panes reject unrelated program titles for both lifecycle and naming;
- a foreign title cannot erase the last provider-owned lifecycle observation;
- a configured Claude Working marker overrides an Idle title and clears an older
  Done latch;
- Codex thread words cannot be parsed as run state;
- title generation advances for changes and ResetTitle;
- weak PTY Working-to-Idle does not latch Done;
- marker/title semantic Working-to-Idle and bell completion both latch Done.

### `muxel`

- a status transition updates and persists instance activity once;
- focusing a Done pane records attendance without clearing lifecycle;
- restored read and unread completions ignore bootstrap Working noise for the
  existing 30-second startup wait plus any configured delay. Provider-owned
  Ready/Idle or an explicit submission ends the guard; fallback PTY quiet does
  not. Blocked
  applies immediately, Idle does not replace Done, and continuous Working wins
  when the startup bound ends;
- later real Working or Blocked evidence replaces persisted Done;
- attention navigation selects Blocked panes and unread Done notifications, not
  attended Done lifecycle;
- agent auto-names accept provider-owned titles and reject child-command titles;

## Manual validation

Build and run `target/debug/muxel.exe`.

1. Open a project containing Claude, Codex, Grok, a plain shell, and one pane with
   a deliberately long title.
2. Confirm the long title ellipsizes and every status remains right-aligned.
3. Type without submitting in each provider. Codex and Grok must not become Done;
   plain-shell PTY activity may briefly show Working but must return to Idle.
4. Run a short task. Confirm Working appears during the run and Done remains after
   completion while another pane is focused.
5. Exercise a Claude review or orchestration state that still shows
   `esc to interrupt` while its title is Idle. Confirm Working replaces an older
   Done state immediately.
6. Focus the Done pane. Confirm the notification clears while Done and its age
   remain.
7. Restart Muxel. Confirm both attended and unattended Done panes retain Done and
   their original completion ages.
8. Start another turn. Confirm Working replaces Done, then the next completion
   produces a new Done timestamp.
9. Trigger a provider permission prompt. Confirm Blocked and its age remain until
   the prompt is resolved.
10. While each provider is idle and working, emit a foreign command title. Confirm
   it changes neither pane name nor lifecycle; the next provider title still wins.
11. Resize the sidebar and terminal repeatedly. Confirm no false Done transition.
12. Verify plain-shell titles and browser/editor/diff panes are unchanged.

## Build gate

Run in the feature worktree:

```powershell
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo build -p muxel
```

## V2, deliberately deferred

- Next unattended agent command.
- Recent Agents palette sorted independently of the stable tree.
- Project-level blocked/unseen rollups.
- Capped run history and overnight digest.
- Per-provider capability diagnostics and update guidance.
- Configurable stale thresholds or playful labels such as `ancient`.
- Optional explicit lifecycle reset if permanently retained Done proves noisy.

V1 succeeds if the fixed tree reliably shows current work, durable completion,
independent notification attendance, and genuinely stale panes without false
claims.
